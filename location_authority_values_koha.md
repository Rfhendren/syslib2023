## Creating Authority Values for Shelf Location in Koha

When creating an item record in Koha you can assign a shelf location to it. The values for shelf location must be pre-assigned however,
as an authority value. The following notes explain how to do this.

1. Log in to Koha as an admin. 

2. Click **Administration** under **More** at the top left of the screen

3. Click **Authorized values** under the **Basic Parameters** heading

4. Find **LOC** (stands for location) and click on it.

5. Click on **New Authorized Value for LOC**. 

From here you can add the shelf locations that you want your library to have. After you have added them, you should be able to select
them when adding/editing an item record.
